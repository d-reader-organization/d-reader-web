Pro tip: For a slicker minting experience do it through the mobile Android app, available on Google Play store and Solana dApp store!

After minting here, create an account to unwrap and read the comic + support more web3 storytellers!
Use referral code '2084'

Then join the Discord to get your comics signed on-chain -- at the creator's discretion.

Appreciate you all! Enjoy the first ever on-chain y00ts comic! üëè
