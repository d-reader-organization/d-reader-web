    account with your Discord account) or Twitter, as well as, in the
    future, for the integration of analytics services such as Google
    Analytics (which is not integrated yet). These service providers
    provide us with authorization tokens you granted us connecting via

2.  Performance of a Contract: When processing is necessary to fulfil
    our contractual obligations if such as Terms & Conditions;

    regulations, if any;

4.  Legitimate interest: When processing is necessary for a legitimate
    interest such as fraud prevention, direct marketing o internal
    administrative purposes, if any.

Each purpose for which we collect and process your data is based on one
or more of these legal bases. These bases ensure transparent and
accountable handling of personal data, safeguarding data subjects'
rights and interests in compliance with relevant data protection laws.

# 7. User Consent Records:

# Maintenance of Consent Records:

We take meticulous care in maintaining records of consent provided by our users when they agree to our Terms of Use (linked), this Privacy Policy, and other related agreements. These records are kept to ensure compliance with our legal obligations which requires that we must be able to demonstrate that consent was given.

# Contents of Consent Records:

Each consent record includes the user’s ID, username, the date and time when the consent was given, the user’s IP address at the time of consent, the specific version of Terms & Conditions or Privacy Policy (including the version of any documents) to which the user consented, and the method of consent (e.g., checkbox, digital signature).

# Access to Consent Records:

Consent records are stored securely and can be accessed only by authorized personnel within our organization. This access is strictly limited to purposes of demonstrating compliance with legal obligations, handling user inquiries, or facilitating audits and investigations.

# Period of Retention:

We retain records of consent for as long as a user’s account remains active and for a reasonable period thereafter to handle any residual issues or inquiries, or as otherwise required by law. If a user withdraws consent, their respective consent record will be archived and retained according to legal requirements, typically for up to five years to comply with data protection regulations.

# Withdrawal of Consent:

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Upon withdrawal, we will cease processing the data for which consent was provided, unless another legal basis for processing legally applies. Users can withdraw their consent by accessing the settings in their user account or by contacting us directly through the [contact methods](#how-to-contact-us) provided in this Privacy Policy. In your user account you shall be able to see in real time, not past consents, and review all given and withdrawn consents.

# Self-help:

The fastest way to edit or delete Personal Data you've provided to us (such as name, password, user ID, email address, and other account information), is to go to your account and modify or delete the information directly. For assistance with this or to further exercise your rights, please send an email to <privacy@dreader.io> with the details of your request.

# Regular Audits:

Our compliance team conducts regular audits to ensure that consent records are complete, accurate, and up to date. These audits also serve to verify that our processes for recording consent meet all regulatory requirements and that we are prepared to show these records promptly if requested by a user or a regulatory authority.

# Notification of Changes:

Any changes to our practices or policies regarding consent records will be communicated to users through updates to this Privacy Policy. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect and use the information we collect.

# 8. How long do we store Personal Data?

It is our policy to retain your Personal Data for the length of time
required for the specific purpose or purposes for which it was
collected. However, we may be obliged to store some Personal Data for a
longer period of time, taking into account factors including:

1.  legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a
    certain period of time;

2.  statute of limitations under applicable law(s);

3.  (potential) disputes and;

4.  guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.

Whilst we continue to process your Personal Data, we will ensure that it
is treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we
securely erase your information once this is no longer needed. We retain
your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
for which it was collected. After the purposes are fulfilled, we will
delete or anonymize your data, unless we have a legal obligation to
retain it for a longer period.

The data retention period is based on **several key factors**:

1.  Duration of the contractual relationship or performance of the
    service: we retain personal data for the duration of the contractual
    relationship with users or as long as it is necessary to provide
    services. This means that the data will be kept as long as the
    contract is active or until the services are fully performed.

2.  Legal obligations: After the expiration of the contractual
    relationship or the performance of the service, the data is stored
    until the expiration of all legal storage obligations. This ensures
    that we comply with relevant regulatory requirements.

3.  Consent: When data is collected based on the consent of the user, we
    will act in accordance with the current status of that consent. If
    the user withdraws his consent, we will stop processing and storing
    the related data.

We strictly follow these data storage guidelines, ensuring that users'
personal data is retained only as necessary and in accordance with legal
requirements and privacy best practices.

# 9. User Rights:

There are multiple jurisdictions that regulate data protection,
including the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and
California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA. Depending on the location of

**10. Third-Party Sharing and international data transfer**

us with related tasks or processes.

These service providers have Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in
